<p>
  This study is a study about Impack of Pythonic idiom in the code. It compare in term of average running time and cleanness of code. There are 2 studies.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>In Pythonic Experiment 1: Have 10 tasks, modify a part of non-Pythonic code to Pythonic code foreach task.</li>
  <li>In Pythonic Experiment 2: Similar to Pythonic Experiment 1 but use the real project (<a href="https://github.com/openstack">OpenStack</a>) and mention some python library or some specific functions.</li>
</ol>
